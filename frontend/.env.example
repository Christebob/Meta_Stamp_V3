# META-STAMP V3 Frontend Environment Configuration Template
# =============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:
# --------------------------
# This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY. Never commit actual secrets or credentials!
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file to .env in the same directory: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Update the values in .env with your actual configuration
# 3. The .env file is gitignored and should NEVER be committed to version control
#
# All environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the
# frontend application at build time. Vite will statically replace these
# variables during the build process.
#
# For more information on Vite environment variables, see:
# https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html
#
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# BACKEND API CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# The base URL for the META-STAMP backend API server.
# In development, this typically points to localhost:8000 where the FastAPI
# backend is running. In production, this should point to your API domain.
#
# Examples:
#   Development: http://localhost:8000
#   Production:  https://api.metastamp.com
#
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# =============================================================================
# AUTH0 AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Auth0 is used for user authentication and authorization.
# These settings must match the Auth0 application configuration in your
# Auth0 dashboard. If Auth0 is not configured, the system will automatically
# fall back to local JWT authentication for development purposes.
#
# To set up Auth0:
# 1. Create an Auth0 account at https://auth0.com
# 2. Create a new Single Page Application in your Auth0 dashboard
# 3. Copy the Domain and Client ID from your application settings
# 4. Configure the Audience in your Auth0 API settings
#
# VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN: Your Auth0 tenant domain (e.g., your-tenant.auth0.com)
# This is the domain for your Auth0 tenant where authentication requests are sent.
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.auth0.com

# VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: The Client ID of your Auth0 Single Page Application
# This uniquely identifies your frontend application to Auth0.
# Find this in Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Your App > Settings
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id

# VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE: The unique identifier for your API in Auth0
# This is used to request access tokens for your backend API.
# Configure this in Auth0 Dashboard > APIs > Your API > Identifier
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.metastamp.com

# =============================================================================
# FEATURE FLAGS
# =============================================================================
# Feature flags allow enabling/disabling specific features without code changes.
# Set to 'true' to enable or 'false' to disable each feature.
#

# VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET: Enable WebSocket connections for real-time updates
# When enabled, the frontend will establish WebSocket connections for:
# - Real-time upload progress updates
# - Live fingerprint processing status
# - Instant notifications
# Set to 'false' to use polling-based updates instead.
VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET=true

# VITE_ENABLE_AI_ASSISTANT: Enable the AI-powered assistant chat feature
# When enabled, users can interact with the multi-provider AI assistant
# (supports OpenAI GPT-4/5, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini).
# Disable this if AI provider API keys are not configured on the backend.
VITE_ENABLE_AI_ASSISTANT=true

# VITE_ENABLE_DARK_MODE: Enable dark mode theme support
# When enabled, users can toggle between light and dark themes.
# The preference is persisted in local storage.
VITE_ENABLE_DARK_MODE=true

# =============================================================================
# UPLOAD CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Configuration for the smart upload system that handles file uploads.
# The system uses a hybrid approach:
# - Files smaller than the threshold use direct upload to the backend
# - Files larger than the threshold use S3 presigned URLs for direct S3 upload
#

# VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB: Maximum allowed file size for uploads in megabytes
# Files exceeding this limit will be rejected before upload begins.
# This must match the backend's MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE configuration.
# Default: 500 MB (as per Agent Action Plan section 0.3 constraints)
VITE_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=500

# VITE_DIRECT_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD_MB: File size threshold for upload routing in MB
# Files smaller than this value use direct upload (multipart/form-data)
# Files equal to or larger than this value use S3 presigned URL upload
# This enables efficient handling of large files without backend bottleneck.
# Default: 10 MB (as per Agent Action Plan section 0.3 hybrid upload architecture)
VITE_DIRECT_UPLOAD_THRESHOLD_MB=10

# =============================================================================
# APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT
# =============================================================================
# Configuration for the application environment and runtime behavior.
#

# VITE_APP_ENV: The current application environment
# Affects logging, error handling, and various development features.
# Valid values:
#   - development: Full logging, development tools enabled, verbose errors
#   - staging: Reduced logging, some development features enabled
#   - production: Minimal logging, all development features disabled
VITE_APP_ENV=development

# =============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: ANALYTICS AND MONITORING (Future Enhancement)
# =============================================================================
# These variables are placeholders for future analytics integration.
# Uncomment and configure when analytics services are set up.
#
# VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
# VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY REMINDERS
# =============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  NEVER commit your actual .env file to version control
# ⚠️  NEVER share your Auth0 credentials publicly
# ⚠️  ALWAYS use environment-specific configurations in production
# ⚠️  ALWAYS review environment variables before deployment
#
# For CI/CD pipelines, configure these variables as secrets in your
# deployment platform (GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables, etc.)
#
